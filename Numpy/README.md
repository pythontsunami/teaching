## Description
After covering the background and scope of the library, we will have a look at severl 
basic aspects before moving on to prolonged exercises. There will be a general introduction
with only one small breakout room. The following will be covered:

- basic comparison to the Python built-in `list` type
- concept of vectorized operations
- basic functions (methods) for mathematical computation
- different data types (`dtype`s)
- the concept of boolean masks
- multidimensional arrays (tables) and their axes.
