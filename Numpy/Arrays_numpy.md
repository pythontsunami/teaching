The first half of this Notebook contain a small introduction to `numpy`. You can also see a [the YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mpc9ukltVA). If you feel comfortable using [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/), you can skip the introduction and go directly to the [exercises (click here)](#exercises). If you would like a recap, keep reading on.

## Introduction

[`numpy`](https://numpy.org/) is a Python package that provides a new type of object: The `ndarray`. This is an N-dimensional array, i.e. a "list" with any number of dimensions.
`numpy` is one of the most fundamental Python packages. Almost all of scientific Python uses [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/) either directly, or indirectly through another package.

[![Figure 2, Harris et. al. 2020](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-020-2649-2/MediaObjects/41586_2020_2649_Fig2_HTML.png?as=webp)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2649-2/figures/2)

It may not be immediately clear why [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/)'s `ndarrays` are so useful that they are everywhere. Do ALL scientific software really need N-dimensional arrays? As you will learn in these exercises, even for 1-dimensional data that *could* be placed in lists, `ndarrays` are generally useful for their convenience and speed.

### Outline
Today, first start with 1-dimensionalal `ndarray`s and use some statistical operations on them. Then, we will have a look at multidimensional arrays by using matrices, i.e. 2-dimensional `ndarray`'s.

Let's get started right away and import `numpy`:


```python
# We can import like this to rename numpy "np"
# and make the name shorter
import numpy as np
```


```python
# # You can accces your drive files by connecting your drive storage
# from google.colab import drive
# drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

## Instantiating (creating) `ndarray`s
We begin with a normal Python list of numbers. *italicized text*


```python
values = [4, 9, 1, 0, 8, 3, 2, 2, 6, 5, 0]
values
```




    [4, 9, 1, 0, 8, 3, 2, 2, 6, 5, 0]



---
We can create an `ndarray` out of this list using the constructor function [`numpy.array`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.array.html#numpy.array), which we pass some data:


```python
array = np.array(values)
print(array)
print(type(array))
```

    [4 9 1 0 8 3 2 2 6 5 0]
    <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
    

You notice the `ndarray` looks a lot like a `list`. You can also construct `ndarrays` from a tuple. 




---
There are many other ways to instantiate (i.e. create) `ndarray`s. Here are a few useful ones to create vector, i.e. `1d`-`ndarray`s. You might need them later!


| function | Purpose |  Example |
| -------- | ------- | ---------|
| **`np.arange`**                  | Makes an array with all the integers between two values | np.arange(2, 7) |
| **`np.linspace`**               | Makes a specific-length array |  np.linspace(2, 3, 10) |
| **`np.zeros`**                    | Makes an array of all zeros | np.zeros(5) |
| **`np.ones`**                     | Makes an array of all ones | np.ones(3) |
| **`np.random.random`** | Makes an array of random numbers | np.random.random(100) |
| **`np.random.randn`**     | Makes an array of normally-distributed random numbers | np.random.randn(100) |



```python
# Create a vector 10 zeros, default dtype is np.float64
print('np.zeros:', np.zeros(10, dtype=np.int64))

# Create an array of a range, similar to the range object
print('np.arange:', np.arange(3, 15, 2))

# Create vector of 10 floats from 3 to 15 having 9
# evenly spaced elements (linear spacing):
print('np.linspace:', np.linspace(3, 15, 9))

# Create a vector of random numbers in the interval [0.0, 1.0)
print('np.random.random:', np.random.random(5))

# Create 9 random integers from 7 to 18
print('np.random.randint:', np.random.randint(7, 19, size=9))
```

    np.zeros: [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    np.arange: [ 3  5  7  9 11 13]
    np.linspace: [ 3.   4.5  6.   7.5  9.  10.5 12.  13.5 15. ]
    np.random.random: [0.37876954 0.06446067 0.07600707 0.6318306  0.54057498]
    np.random.randint: [18 15  8 13 15 16 10  7 11]
    

## Slicing
We can access and assign individual numbers in an `ndarray` like we do with `list`:


```python
print(array)
print(array[2])
print(array[2:6])
array[3] = 10
print(array)
```

    [4 9 1 0 8 3 2 2 6 5 0]
    1
    [1 0 8 3]
    [ 4  9  1 10  8  3  2  2  6  5  0]
    

---
We can also loop over the `ndarray`, reverse it, and so on. The full list of methods you find in the docs of [`numpy.ndarray`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html)

There are two main limitations that `ndarrays` have compared to lists. We cannot use `append` or `pop`, or other operations that *changes* the array *in-place*:


```python
array.append(3)
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-52-e9cb6c9fca85> in <module>
    ----> 1 array.append(3)
    

    AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'append'


We can however append several arrays together is slightly different way by using numpy.append(arr, values, axis=None) [`numpy.append`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.append.html)


```python
np.append([1, 2, 3], [1])
```


```python
np.append([1, 2, 3], [[4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
```

## Breakout rooms

### Exercise 1: Create Arrays
1. Define an array called `things` that 10 integers.  The data is completely up to you.
2. Define an array of 20 random floats from 0 to 100
3. Define an evenly spaced array of 20 random floats from 0 to 100


```python

```

### Exercise 2: Access items
1. Print out the second element in your array `things`.
2. Append `[4, 5, 22]` to `things`
3. Remove `22` from `things` (you need to find this one)


```python

```

## Data type of arrays (`dtype`)

The second disadvantage is that an `ndarray` can only contain one kind of data at a time, i.e. `float` or `int` etc. The data type is given by the `dtype` field of the array:


```python
array.dtype
```

---
This array contains `np.int64`, a type representing 64-bit integers. If we try to add a `float` to the array, it will be converted to an `np.int64`, or raise an error if that is not possible.


```python
# 1.7 can be "converted" by rounding down to 1
# (i.e) removing the fraction part, keeping the interger part 1
array[2] = 1.7
print(array)

# "hello" cannot be converted to an integer
array[2] = "hello" # "2" would work
```

    [ 4  9  1 10  8  3  2  2  6  5  0]
    


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-53-169bd88d1684> in <module>
          5 
          6 # "hello" cannot be converted to an integer
    ----> 7 array[2] = "hello" # "2" would work
    

    ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'hello'


There is a type that allows mixing items of different type: object


```python
array2 = array.astype('object')
```


```python
array2[2] = "hello"
```


```python
array2
```




    array([4, 9, 'hello', 10, 8, 3, 2, 2, 6, 5, 0], dtype=object)



---
There are many possible datatypes - you can read more about them [on this link (click)](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.dtypes.html). However, we will only look at a few data types.

When you construct an `ndarray`, `numpy` will try to automatically detect the input data type:


```python
array = np.array([1, 2, 3]) # again: constructor utility function np.array
print(array, array.dtype)

array = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3])
print(array, array.dtype)
```

    [1 2 3] int32
    [1. 2. 3.] float64
    

---
Be careful when constructing `ndarrays` - for example if you try to construct an `ndarray` from a set object, which is not a list or a tuple, it simply create a 1-element `ndarray` containing the set as its only element, and the datatype will be `object`:


```python
array = np.array({1,2,3})
print("array: ", array)
print("dtype: ", array.dtype)
```

    array:  {1, 2, 3}
    dtype:  object
    

---
You can also manually specify the data type you want. Notice here that it converts `2.5` to `2`:


```python
np.array([1.0, 2.5, 3.0], dtype=np.int64)
```




    array([1, 2, 3], dtype=int64)



---
And you can convert one numpy array to one with another dtype:


```python
array = np.array([1, 2, 3])
array.astype(np.float64)
```




    array([1., 2., 3.])



## Vectorized operations

Conveniently, for many operations like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**` and others apply to each element of an `ndarray` automatically. For example, if you write: `array + 5`, this will add 5 to **every element** in the array. This is termed vectorized operations:


```python
array = np.array([4, 8, 1, 2, 9, 3, 7])
print(array)
print(array + 5)
print(array * 2)
print(array / 2)
print(array**2)
print(0.4 * array**2 + 1.5 * array - 0.9)
```

    [4 8 1 2 9 3 7]
    [ 9 13  6  7 14  8 12]
    [ 8 16  2  4 18  6 14]
    [2.  4.  0.5 1.  4.5 1.5 3.5]
    [16 64  1  4 81  9 49]
    [11.5 36.7  1.   3.7 45.   7.2 29.2]
    

> Think about the difference of what the `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` operators invoke in comparison to `str` or `list` built-in types.

Because these vectorized operations actually execute code written in the programming language C, they are much, much faster than ordinary Python:


```python
import random

# Create a vector of 1 million random floats in [0.0, 1.0):
python_list = [random.random() for i in range(1_000_000)]

# Convert the Python list to a Numpy vector 
numpy_vector = np.array(python_list)
```


```python
%time results = [2*x + 3 for x in python_list] # List comprehension are optimized
```

    Wall time: 90 ms
    


```python
%%time
collection_manipulated = []
for x in python_list:
    collection_manipulated.append(2*x + 3)
```

    Wall time: 157 ms
    


```python
# On Jacob's computer, this is >200x faster than Python 
# In colab (with the lastest Python version?) this is still ~70x faster
# On my machine it is reduced to a 22x faster
%timeit results = 2*numpy_vector + 3
```

    4.1 ms ± 109 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
    

## Masking
Importantly, the comparison operators `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `==`, `!=` are also vectorized. Since these operators always return a `bool` (i.e. `True` or `False`), the result is an `ndarray` of data type `bool`. For example, we can check whether each element in `array` is greater than 3:


```python
array = np.array([4, 8, 1, 2, 9, 3, 7])
mask_above_3 = array > 3
print(mask_above_3)  
print(mask_above_3.dtype)
array[mask_above_3] # explanation: see next section
```

    [ True  True False False  True False  True]
    bool
    




    array([4, 8, 9, 7])



### Exercise 3: Masking
1. Define an array of 100 random floats from 0 to 1000 and select those elements that are below 500
2. In the same array, select those elements above 50 and below 300

> If you are done, try to apply formulas to the whole data or try to change the `dtype`



```python

```

## Logical indexing using masking
*Logical indexing* refers to indexing an `ndarray` using another `ndarray` of dtype `bool`. This selects every element of the `ndarray` paired with the value `True`: For example:


```python
array = np.array([1, 4, 6, 5, 0, 2, 9, 10, 0, 2, 7, 5])
print('array:', array)
mask_nonzero = array != 0
print('nonzero:', mask_nonzero)

# Now get all elements that are not zero:
# Each element in array gets picked if nonzero is True
array[mask_nonzero]
```

    array: [ 1  4  6  5  0  2  9 10  0  2  7  5]
    nonzero: [ True  True  True  True False  True  True  True False  True  True  True]
    




    array([ 1,  4,  6,  5,  2,  9, 10,  2,  7,  5])



---
You can also assign to an `ndarray` using logical indexing. This will change all the numbers where the boolean array is `True`:


```python
array[mask_nonzero] = 100
print(array) 
```

    [100 100 100 100   0 100 100 100   0 100 100 100]
    

To combine you can use the "bit-wise" operators `&` (logical and) and `|` (logical or), or one of the [logical operations](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.logic.html#logical-operations)

<a id='ndarray_methods'></a>
## `ndarray` methods 

In addition to the vectorized opertaions, the `array` object also have some methods (i.e. functions of the object type or class `array`) to conveniently perform operations on the arrays. Like vectorized operations, these methods are very fast. The full list of methods you find in the docs of [`numpy.array`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.ndarray.html#array-methods).


```python
array = np.array([4, 8, 1, 2, 9, 3, 7])
print("Our array:", array)
print("Calculate sum:", array.sum())
print("Calculate mean:", array.mean())
print("Calculate variance:", array.var())
print("Calculate standard deviation:", array.std())
print("Calculate minimum/maximum:", array.min(), array.max())
```

    Our array: [4 8 1 2 9 3 7]
    Calculate sum: 34
    Calculate mean: 4.857142857142857
    Calculate variance: 8.408163265306122
    Calculate standard deviation: 2.8996833043120627
    Calculate minimum/maximum: 1 9
    

The methods performed on the `ndarray` can also be performed on different datastructures than arrays using numpy functions with idential names to the methods of an `ndarray`:


```python
np.sum([4, 8, 1, 2, 9, 3, 7])
```




    34



---
Additional functions are not implemented as methods of `ndarray`, but can be found by typing `np.FUNCITON_NAME` such as:

```python
np.log
np.sqrt
np.any
np.all,
```
and many, many more. In general, basic math operations, statistical operations and linear algebra is implemented in Numpy. Any other kind of number-crunching operation you might possibly need can be found in Scipy.



```python
 print(np.log(array)) # ln
```

    [1.38629436 2.07944154 0.         0.69314718 2.19722458 1.09861229
     1.94591015]
    

## Higher dimensional arrays

The reason they are called `ndarray`s are that they are N-dimensional. 
In the exercises, you can work on matrices, i.e. `2d-array`s.

First a little notation:
* A 1-dimensional array is a vector. A `2d-array` is a matrix. An N-dimensional array is called a tensor or an array.
* The number of dimensions of a tensor is its rank. So a matrix is a tensor of rank 2.
* In `numpy`, the size of an array refers to the total number of elements. The shape of an array is a tuple with the length of the array in each of its dimensions. The length of an array is the length of the first dimension.
* An axis is the same as a dimension.

Many ways of instantiating `ndarrays` have an optional keyword that allows us to specify its shape:

### Instantiate
- list of list, etc


```python
data = [[1, 5, 3, 9],
        [9, 4, 2, 4],
        [0, 6, 5, 1]]
data = np.array(data)
data
```




    array([[1, 5, 3, 9],
           [9, 4, 2, 4],
           [0, 6, 5, 1]])




```python
print("Shape:", data.shape)
print("Dimensions (Axes):", data.ndim)
```

    Shape: (3, 4)
    Dimensions (Axes): 2
    

### reshape


```python
data.reshape((4,-1))
```




    array([[1, 5, 3],
           [9, 9, 4],
           [2, 4, 0],
           [6, 5, 1]])



### Axis

- As we now have row and columns we can perform operations along the rows (`axis=0`) or along the columns (`row=1`). What is the mean along the rows? What along the columns?

> see [the methods section](#ndarray_methods) for further methods


```python
print(data)
data.sum() # default along all axis
```

    [[1 5 3 9]
     [9 4 2 4]
     [0 6 5 1]]
    




    49




```python
data.sum(axis=0)
```




    array([10, 15, 10, 14])




```python
data.sum(axis=1)
```




    array([18, 19, 12])



### new axis

- sometimes needed for broadcasting (next sections)
- You might need this if you later move to machine learning and start using [sklearn](https://github.com/Center-for-Health-Data-Science/PythonTsunami/tree/intro/ML)


```python
data[:,:, np.newaxis].shape
np.expand_dims(data, axis=-1).shape
```




    (3, 4, 1)



Removing a trailing axis is done using `squeeze`


```python
data = np.expand_dims(data, axis=-1)
data = data.squeeze()
data.shape
```




    (3, 4)



### broadcasting

**Broadcasting** is a technique automatically matching arrays of different shape - if they are compatible. Read the [numpy guide on broadcasting](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html) (which is the default behaviour in many array libraries)


```python
data * 5
```




    array([[ 5, 25, 15, 45],
           [45, 20, 10, 20],
           [ 0, 30, 25,  5]])




```python
data / data.sum(axis=1)[:, np.newaxis]
```




    array([[0.05555556, 0.27777778, 0.16666667, 0.5       ],
           [0.47368421, 0.21052632, 0.10526316, 0.21052632],
           [0.        , 0.5       , 0.41666667, 0.08333333]])

## Breakout rooms - Extended exercises

In all of these exercises, do not loop over the `ndarray`s you create. All exercises can be solved using only vectorized operations on your arrays.

## Simple vectorized operations

You want to plot the mathematical function

$f(x) = log(-1.3x^2 + 1.4^x + 7x + 50)$

For the numbers in $[0, 20]$. To do this, you need to create a vector `xs` with lots of numbers between 0 and 20, and a vector `ys` with $f$ evaluated at every element of `xs`. A vector is a `1d-ndarray`.

To get a hang of vectorized operations, solve the problem *without using any loops*:

### Create a vector `xs` with 1000 evenly spaced points between 0 and 20


```python

```

### Create a Python function $f$ as seen above


```python

```

### Evaluate `ys` = $f(x)$, i.e. $f$ of every element of `xs`.


```python

```

### What is the mean and standard deviation of `ys`?


```python

```

### How many elements of. `ys` are below 0? Between 1 and 2, both exclusive?

> Hint: You can use a comparison operator to get an array of dtype `bool`. To get the number of elements that are `True`, you can exploit the fact that `True` behaves similar to the number 1, and `False` similar to the number 0.


```python

```


```python

```

### What is the minimum and maximum value of `ys`?


```python

```

### Create a vector `non_negatives`, which contain all the values of `ys` that are nonnegative.


```python

```

### *Extra*: Use `matplotlib` to plot `xs` vs `ys`.

## Species matrix

Load in the data [`depths.csv`](https://github.com/pythontsunami/teaching/tree/intro/data/depths.csv). As you can see loading the first line below, there are 11 columns, with columns 2-11 representing a sample from a human gut microbiome. Each row represents a genome of a micro-organism, a so-called "operational taxonomic unit at 97% sequence identity" (OTU_97). The first row gives the name of the genome. The values in the matrix represents the relative abundance (or depth) of that micro-organism in that sample, i.e. how much of the micro-organism there is.


```python
# If you have a local copy of the repository, this is the path to the file depths.csv
from pathlib import Path
filepath = Path('../data/depths.csv')
```


```python
# Download in colab
# You can use Bash commands by prepending them with: !
if not filepath.exists():
    !mkdir -p data
    !wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pythontsunami/teaching/intro/data/depths.csv -P data
    filepath = Path('data/depths.csv')
```


```python
with open(filepath) as file:
  for i, line in enumerate(file):
    print(line)
    if i > 5:
      break

### Load in the matrix in some data structure of your choice, but make sure the numbers in each row is an `ndarray`.


```python

```

### How many OTUs are there? Show how you figured it out.


```python

```

### Find the OTU "OTU_97.41189.0". What is the mean and standard deviations of the depths across the 10 samples of this OTU?


```python

```

### How many samples have 0 depth of that OTU? (or rather, below detection limit?)


```python

```

### What is the mean and standard deviation if you exclude those samples?


```python

```

### We are not interested in OTUs present in fewer than 4 samples. Remove all those OTUs.


```python

```

### How many OTUs did you remove?


```python

```

### How many OTUs have a depth of > 5 in all 10 samples? (hint: `np.all`)


```python

```

### Filtering and Normalization

After discarding all OTUs present in fewer than 4 samples, sort the OTUs, do the following:
 - Calculate the mean depth across samples for each remaining OTU.
 - Normalize the remaining OTUs such that each row sum to 0 and have a standard deviation of 1 (so-called z-score normalization)
 - Print the remaining OTUs to a new file in descending order by their mean depth, with a 12th column giving the mean depth, and columns 1-11 being the normalized depth. Make sure that your file looks like the input file (except with the 12th column)


```python

```

##  Optional exercise: Sequence data as an array
_Only do it if you have extra time._

### load data 

Create a function that loads a FASTA file into a `dict` where each key is the FASTA header and the value is an  `ndarray` corresponding to the sequence. Remember that you need to instantiate `ndarray` from a list, not a string. Test it using the `Yersinia pestis` fasta file. You can verify that your `ndarray` has the correct length by checking the `.size` attribute:
  
`array.size`


```python

```

### Check data
Make your function verify that there are only 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and 'N' in the sequence. Convert lowercase letters to uppercase letters.


```python

```

### GC count
Create a function that calculates GC content of your `ndarray` representing a DNA sequence - ignore Ns. Remember to still use vectorized operations.


```python

```

### Profile
Use the Jupyter `%timeit` functionality to compare the time spent in your vectorized GC-content function with the GC-content function you created in exercise 2 last monday. See the use of `%timeit` in this Notebook for an example.


```python

```
